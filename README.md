# Customer-Relationship-Management-Analysis

## Overview  

This **CRM Data Analysis** project focuses on analyzing customer relationship management (CRM) data to uncover insights that can drive better business decisions. The primary objective is to identify trends, diagnose business issues, and provide actionable recommendations to improve performance across key metrics such as sales, revenue, and regional success.  

The project utilizes **SQL** for data cleaning, transformation, and analysis, and **Excel** for advanced analysis and dashboard creation to present insights visually.  

### Key Insights:
- **Product Demand and Pricing:** Product prices significantly influence demand and revenue. Some products with high demand generate low revenue, while others have low demand due to high prices.  
- **Sales Team Performance:** Disparities in sales team performance were observed, with top performers engaging in significantly more transactions than their peers.  
- **Regional Trends:** The Eastern region was identified as the lowest-performing region, requiring targeted interventions.  

### Recommendations:
- Adjust pricing strategies to capitalize on high-demand products and stimulate demand for low-performing ones.  
- Incentivize underperforming sales agents or consider reassignment as needed.  
- Investigate operational or market factors contributing to the underperformance in the Eastern region and address them accordingly.  

## Data  

The project analyzed CRM data from four key tables:  
- **Products:** Information on the 7 products offered by the business.  
- **Accounts:** Details about customers.  
- **Sales Teams:** Performance metrics of sales agents.  
- **Sales Pipeline:** Data on transactions and deals.  

### Data Cleaning & Transformation  

The data underwent the following transformation steps:  
1. **Loading Data:** Four CSV files were imported into a SQL database for processing.  
2. **Data Cleaning:** Spelling errors were corrected, and dates were formatted for SQL compatibility.  
3. **Relationship Mapping:** Primary and foreign keys were defined to create relationships between tables.  
4. **Data Integration:** Tables were combined into a centralized dataset for holistic analysis.  
5. **Export for Visualization:** The consolidated data was exported to Excel for creating an interactive dashboard.  

## Analysis & Insights  

Comprehensive analysis of the data led to the following conclusions:  
1. **Product Pricing Impact:** Product prices directly affect demand and revenue, highlighting the need for strategic pricing adjustments.  
2. **Sales Agent Performance:** Significant gaps were identified between top-performing and underperforming sales agents.  
3. **Regional Performance:** The Eastern region consistently underperformed, suggesting possible operational or market challenges.  

## Dashboard  

An interactive Excel dashboard was developed to visualize key insights and trends, allowing stakeholders to:  
- Monitor sales performance across regions and agents.  
- Analyze product demand and revenue generation.  
- Track overall business metrics and identify areas needing improvement.  

## Tools Used
